# Buckinghamshire-Social-Unrest-Prediction-Dashboard
## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the Buckinghamshire Social Unrest Prediction Dashboard. The project aims to predict the likelihood of social unrest events in different wards of Buckinghamshire using statistical modeling and data visualization. This tool provides actionable insights to help the local government proactively address potential unrest, improving community safety and decision-making processes.

## Features
Predictive Modeling: Uses statistical methods and Python to estimate the likelihood of social unrest events.
Interactive Dashboard: Developed with Power BI for dynamic visualizations of predictive results.
Data-Driven Insights: Helps identify high-risk areas and patterns using ward-specific data.
Automation: Reduces manual reporting tasks, enhancing operational efficiency.
## Technology Stack
Programming Languages: Python
Visualization Tools: Power BI, Matplotlib
Data Management: Excel, Pandas
Libraries: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
Power BI Desktop (latest version)
### Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Buckinghamshire-Social-Unrest-Prediction.git
cd Buckinghamshire-Social-Unrest-Prediction
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the dashboard.pbix file in Power BI Desktop to explore the interactive dashboard.

## Usage
Data Preparation: Place raw datasets in the data/ folder and run the preprocessing script in scripts/data_preprocessing.py.
Model Training: Execute scripts/train_model.py to train the prediction model on prepared data.
Generate Predictions: Use scripts/predict.py to forecast social unrest probabilities for each ward.
Dashboard Update: Load updated data into the Power BI dashboard to visualize the latest predictions.
## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of XX% during validation.
The dashboard reduced manual reporting time by 30% and enhanced decision-making for local security teams.
## Future Enhancements
Integration of real-time data streams for live prediction updates.
Expansion of predictive features to include additional social and economic variables.
Deployment of a web-based version of the dashboard for broader accessibility.
