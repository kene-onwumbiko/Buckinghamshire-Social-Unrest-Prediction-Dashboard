# Buckinghamshire-Social-Unrest-Prediction-Dashboard
## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the Buckinghamshire Social Unrest Prediction Dashboard. The project aims to predict the likelihood of social unrest events in different wards of Buckinghamshire using statistical modeling and data visualization. This tool provides actionable insights to help the local government proactively address potential unrest, improving community safety and decision-making processes.

## Features
Predictive Modeling: Uses statistical methods and Python to estimate the likelihood of social unrest events.
Interactive Dashboard: Developed with Power BI for dynamic visualizations of predictive results.
Data-Driven Insights: Helps identify high-risk areas and patterns using ward-specific data.
Automation: Reduces manual reporting tasks, enhancing operational efficiency.
## Technology Stack
Programming Languages: Python
Visualization Tools: Power BI
Data Management: Excel
Libraries: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
## Usage
Data Preparation: Place raw datasets in the data/ folder and run the preprocessing script in scripts/data_preprocessing.py.
Model Training: Execute scripts/train_model.py to train the prediction model on prepared data.
Generate Predictions: Use scripts/predict.py to forecast social unrest probabilities for each ward.
Dashboard Update: Load updated data into the Power BI dashboard to visualize the latest predictions.
## Future Enhancements
Integration of real-time data streams for live prediction updates.
Expansion of predictive features to include additional social and economic variables.
Deployment of a web-based version of the dashboard for broader accessibility.
